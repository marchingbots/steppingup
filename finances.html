    <h3 class=" pt-3">Overview</h3>
    <h4 class="text-warning">
       Regardless of practice size, all successful firms have one
thing in common. They are organised businesses with consistently implemented systems
and procedures that ensure the practice attracts clients and matters, completes the work
efficiently and expeditiously, prices the work above cost and collects debtors promptly.

    <h3 class=" pt-3">Concepts</h3>
<h5>
  1. Pricing - Billing Rate  <br>
 <br>
 The following approaches are used in high-performing firms to ensure lawyers achieve
their hourly budgets: <br>
• Meeting daily with junior lawyers to help them plan their day – the open door policy
works well in conjunction with structured daily meetings, but is a poor substitute; <br>
• Reviewing the file load of all lawyers to ensure they have properly prioritised their time
and that no critical dates slip through the net; <br>
• A one-on-one meeting each week with each fee-earner to discuss objective and
subjective performance issues; <br>
• Six-monthly file closing days where all lawyers bring their difficult files. The group as
a whole work through each file with the aim of closing or advancing as many as possible.
In addition to the obvious financial benefits, there is a positive impact on lawyer stress
levels as their difficult files have been turned into fees.
 <br>
</h5>
<br><br>
<h3>2. Realisation</h3>

<h5>
    a measure of the percentage of the work done (ie work-in-progress or WIP)
which is actually billed to clients. <br>
<br>
eg. For example: assume you spent 10 hours working on a matter at a rate of $300 per hour
and you invoiced the client $2,500; your realisation would be calculated as:
$2,500/(10 hours x $300) = 83.33%
<br><br>
</h5>
<h3>
    3. Margin Management        
</h3>
<h5>
    A well-leveraged practice will most likely have a salaries margin (excluding the equity
principals) of greater than 40%. This will usually result in a profit margin
(before principals’ salaries) of less than 30%. The overall profitability of such a practice in
terms of net profit per principal will be quite high as the profit is shared among fewer
principals.
</h5>
<br><br>
<h3>
    4. Pricing, Cost of Production, and discounting
</h3>
<h5>
In the business of legal practice one of the major differentiators between the most profitable
and those less so has always been price. <br> <br>
solicitors underpricing is their desire to justify price objectively.
Unfortunately, most practices do not have the data to enable them to make these decisions
accurately, so they make them anecdotally and incorrectly. <br><br>
CALCULATE PRICING =>calculate cost of productivity <br>
In a law office, record time. <br>
Total overheads (including break-even salary for partners) DIVIDED by total chargeable hours  = COST PER CHARGEABLE HOUR. <br>
The average profit margin (after a commercial salary for equity principals) for small law
practices is around 12.25%. If you are average and you put your fees up by 6%, you could
achieve a 50% increase in profit. Even if you lost some clients you will still be much better
off. <br><br>
<span class="text-warning">This is where the psychology of pricing comes into the argument. If you are going to be
expensive you must be good. All of those things that you know influence satisfaction should
be excellent. You must perform. You must perform on or ahead of time. You and your staff
must be pleasant to deal with. You must be totally client-focused at all times.</span>

        In McGuire v Manawatu Standards Committee21 the Court considered the use of the word
“recommendation” in footnote 3 to r 3.4, significantly softened the mandatory nature of
r 3.4. Arguably, what is intended in r 3.4 is that the disclosures required by that rule must
occur prior to undertaking significant work under a retainer.<br><br>
<h4> Info to be provided in advance</h4><br>
<h5>1. Principal aspects of client service <br>
    - r 3.4 gives non-exhaustive examples: 
    a. basis upon which fees will be charged, <br>
    b. when fees must be paid, <br>
    c. if lawyer intends to deduct fees from the trust account - client must be informed in advance (ss 9 and 10 of LCA trust account regs), ; <br>
    d. lawyer's procedure for handling complaints by clients <br>
    e. how a client complaints to law society ; <br><br>

    Rule 3.5 RCCC provides additional info to that required under s 94(j) LCA: <br>
    a. copy of client care and service information; <br>
    b. name and status of persons who will have general carriage of, or responsiblity for, the work; <br>

        - equitable foundation of english lawyer's core duties|: Nocton v Lord Ashburton [1914] AC 932 <br>
        - - breach of duties is equitable fraud => now expanded into breaches of fiduciary duty <br><br>

        IT IS IMPORTANT to establish exactly what the lawyer is required to do by the terms of the retainer when considering the nature of the fiduciary obligation. <br><br>
        - determined by all factors/circumstances  including nature of work to be done. <br>
        - parties to fiduciary relationship are free to alter those obligations by agreement <br>
        - where lawyer cannot discharge duties without a conflicting dute => no waiver of conflict of interest permitted. <br> <br>
        Taylor v Schofield Peterson [1999] 3 NZLR 434, 440 <br>
        solicitors who are
        seeking the consent of their client to limit the fiduciary duty when he said that the solicitor
        must: <br>
        • explain to the client what the conflict is;<br>
        • further explain to the client the ramifications of that conflict (for instance, it may be that
        they could not give advice which ordinarily they would have given); <br>
        • ensure that the client has a proper appreciation of the conflict, and its implications; and <br>
        • obtain the informed consent of that client.

            <h5>
                Chapter 9 RCCC <br>
                Underlying principle: lawyer is a fiduciary of the client and must take into account the interests of the client when setting a  fee  
                 <br><br>
                r 9.1 => fee that is fair and reasonable for the services required.  
                <br><br>
                Fees in advance: <br>
                rr 3.4 and 9.3 of RCCC <br>
                regs 9 and 10 of LCA trust account regs <br>
                <br>
                No debiting of fees prior to work: A lawyer may not take fees for work which is yet to be
                completed – reg 10 of the LCA (Trust Account) Regulations 2008. <br>
                Estimates: If requested, a lawyer must provide an estimate of fees – r 9.4. <br>
                Estimate exceeded: A lawyer must inform the client promptly if it becomes apparent that
                the fee estimate is likely to be exceeded – r 9.4. <br>

                Legal aid: A lawyer must advise a client if legal aid might be available (although a lawyer
                may also indicate that they are not prepared to work on legal aid) – r 9.5. <br>
                Prompt final account: A lawyer must render a final account to the client or person charged
                within a reasonable time of concluding a matter or the retainer being otherwise terminated
                – r 9.6. <br>

                Reporting with account: The lawyer must provide sufficient information to identify the
                matter, the period to which it relates and the work undertaken with the final account – r 9.6. <br>
                Conditional fees: If a conditional fee arrangement is entered into, particular rules
                (rr 9.8 – 9.12) must be complied with (see the further discussion in this section). <br>
                Fee sharing: It is misconduct to share a fee with a non-lawyer pursuant to s 7(3) of the LCA
                (this is an effective prohibition on multidisciplinary practices). Fee sharing with other
                lawyers is permitted only where the lawyers have worked on the matter or the split is due
                to the sale of a legal practice (see RCCC, rr 9.13 and 9.14). <br>
                Fees of lawyers selling real estate: Particular rules relating to lawyers selling real estate are
                found in rr 16.3 to 16.6 of the RCCC. Most importantly, lawyers may not charge a
                percentage commission when selling real estate – Real Estate Agents Act 1976, s 3(7).<br>
