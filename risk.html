<!-- Fourth Box  -->

   <div class="container border border-success">
    <h3 class=" pt-3">Mindset</h3>
        <h5>
            1. Working ON the business versus IN the business<br>
            - eg. lawyer vs practice manager; <br><br>

            2. How much billable time allocated to risk management. <br><br>

   <!-- Fifth Box  -->

   <div class="container border border-success">
    <h3 class=" pt-3">Understanding RM </h3>
        <h5>
            1. Risk is something that can hurt you <br>
            - put you out of business <br>
            - damage practice assets <br><br>

            2. Advance Risk topics <br>
            - risk as OCCURRNCE OF adverse event VS risk as UNCERTAINTY of event <br>
            - mananing PROBABILITY of adverse event VS managing flow-on effects of the event <br><br>
            3. Delay of providing services <br>
            - negatively impacts customer satisfaction, legal liability, cash flow <br>
            - SOLUTION: adequacy of resources, supervision, workflow systems <br>
            - managing effects = client communication, indemnity insurance, increasing overdraft <br><br>

            DO SOMETHING TODAY TO SAFEGUARD AGAINST BEING HURT TOMORROW.
