   Disciplinary standards: <br>
   - misconduct s 7 LCA <br>
   - wilful or reckless contravention of any provision of the act <br><br>
   - unsatisfactory conduct s 12 LCA <br><br>

   RCCC <br>
   - r. 1.5.2 : preservation of dignity and repuation of legal profession is responsibility of every lawyer. <br><br>

   regulatory regime focuses on complaints resolution rather than professional discipline. <br>
   - lawyers must have their own complaint resolution mechanism per s. 94(j)(iv). <br>
   - explicit recognition some complaints can be resolved by negotiation or mediation per ss 143 and 201. <br>
   - s 138: if an aggrieved person does not want to pursue the matter, this is grounds for the standards committee to decide to take no action <br><br>

   Competence is a professional standard per s 12 LCA.

            </h3><br>
            <h5>
        In McGuire v Manawatu Standards Committee21 the Court considered the use of the word
“recommendation” in footnote 3 to r 3.4, significantly softened the mandatory nature of
r 3.4. Arguably, what is intended in r 3.4 is that the disclosures required by that rule must
occur prior to undertaking significant work under a retainer.<br><br>
<h4> Info to be provided in advance</h4><br>
<h5>1. Principal aspects of client service <br>
    - r 3.4 gives non-exhaustive examples: 
    a. basis upon which fees will be charged, <br>
    b. when fees must be paid, <br>
    c. if lawyer intends to deduct fees from the trust account - client must be informed in advance (ss 9 and 10 of LCA trust account regs), ; <br>
    d. lawyer's procedure for handling complaints by clients <br>
    e. how a client complaints to law society ; <br><br>

    Rule 3.5 RCCC provides additional info to that required under s 94(j) LCA: <br>
    a. copy of client care and service information; <br>
    b. name and status of persons who will have general carriage of, or responsiblity for, the work; <br>
    c.  any provision that limits extent of lawyer's obligation to the client, or limits or excludes liabilty  <br><br>

        3. Consider the law <br><br>
        4. Identify the options  <br>
        - from doing nothing to the most radical option <br><br>

        - risk of cost blowout passes from client to the firm <br>
        - price the job taking the risk factor into account <br><br>
        3. Hybrid Time and Fixed fees <br>
        - where part of the task is uncertain but once completed, leads to more certainty <br><br>
