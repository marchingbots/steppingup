            <h5>Why is matter and file management important? <br>
            - a high standard of application will ensure we should be acting, identify client wants, keep client finance records in order, minimise risk, increase profitibility <br><br>
            Standards <br>
            - 1. the ground to be covered <br>
            - RCCC contains many of these standards <br><br>

<h5>
   Legal Project Management: <br>
    The application of knowledge, skills, tools, and techniques to project activities to
meet project requirements. Project management is accomplished through the
application and integration of the project management processes of initiating,
planning, executing, monitoring and closing. <br><br>

What do LPMs do? <br>
Legal project managers plan, organise, motivate and control resources (mainly people)
to deliver the client’s specific goals. They are an enabler who removes roadblocks and
ensures the required work is completed and that the right resources are applied to the
work at the right time. <br><br>
They manage TIME, SCOPE and COST. <br><br>

LPM Framework: <br>
1. Definition: identifying the client's requirements <br>
2. Planning: Plan the work that needs to be done <br>
3. Execution: Undertake the work to deliver client's requirements <br>
4. Close out: Review and close the file. <br><br>

                Why? <br>

                what is a successful outcome for the client? what are the risk? areas lacking information? budget expectations? what work will be done? what work won't be done? <br><br>
                Who? <br>
                who has an interest in the matter? who else needs to be involved? what will the project team look like? <br><br>
                When? <br>
                when do things need to happen? client has specific time requirements? any key dates or events as hard deadlines? do we need to report on progress? <br><br>
                Where? <br>
                where does the instruction exist? what is its context/environment? did the client agree to the approved definition document?

        Phased planning is <span class="text-danger">ROLLING WAVE PLANNING.</span> <br><br>
        First step is identify work required to deliver project objectives. <br>
